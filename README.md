# Bro-Log-Utility-Script

This script will allow you to slice different types of Bro Logs for better data analysis.  Currently you can only combine multiple log files together into one file, slice a log based off of the fields, slice a conn.log based off of the port and run multiple PCAPs against the Bro IDS.
